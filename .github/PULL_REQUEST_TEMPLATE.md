<!--
Automated release notes instructions:

1. Select the type of release note by leaving only one bullet point and deleting
   the rest. This will tell the release note script where to put your note and
   how to format it.

   Descriptions for formatting:
   - Highlighted sections should start with a heading 2 (two `##`) and can contain
     screenshots. Use this type of section to capture attention for notable
     features and fixes.
   - One-line sections should only contain one line. Use this kind of section to
     add short and sweet notices to the release notes.

2. Add your release notes for this PR after "START RELEASE NOTES" line. During
   the day of the release, all commits will be matched with a PR (if any) and
   your release notes will go into a generated release notes template for
   review by editorial (it will be reviewed before going so don't worry about
   making it perfect).
